## Description

This project focuses on analysing loan payment data to derive insights into customer payment behaviour and potential risks. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualisation of key indicators related to loan status, recovery percentages, and potential losses.

The main goals of the project are:

1.Identify indicators that may suggest a customer is unable to pay the loan.

2.Analyse loan grades, purposes, and home ownership as potential factors affecting loan repayment.

3.Visualise and understand the distribution of loan statuses and recovery percentages.

Throughout the project, various Python scripts have been developed to perform data transformation, correlation analysis, and payments analysis. These scripts assist in uncovering patterns, trends, and potential risks within the loan payment dataset, aiding in informed decision-making for the lending institution.

The project presented several challenges, particularly in the tasks of removing outliers and cleaning the data. Handling outliers required careful consideration, as it involved balancing the removal of extreme values without losing valuable information. The data cleaning process was also intricate, demanding a systematic approach to ensure accurate and reliable analyses.

Despite the challenges, these tasks provided a valuable learning experience. The intricacies of data cleaning and outlier removal deepened my understanding of data quality and the importance of thorough preprocessing for robust analyses. This experience enhances my proficiency in handling real-world datasets and extracting meaningful insights from complex financial data.
